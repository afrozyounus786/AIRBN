1. What is state?

In networking and software systems, state means information stored about a session or interaction between two parties (like client and server).

If a server remembers details about the client (previous requests, login status, preferences, etc.), it is stateful.

If the server does not remember anything about the client and treats every request as new, it is stateless.

2. Express Sessions

express-session is a middleware in Express.js (Node.js framework) that allows you to make HTTP “stateful” by remembering user sessions.

It does this by:

Creating a session for each user after login (or first visit).

Storing session data on the server (like user ID, cart items, preferences).

Sending a session ID to the browser in a cookie.

On the next request, the browser sends back that cookie, and the server looks up the session data using the session ID.


app.use(session({ secret: "mysupersecretkey" }));

app.get("/secret",(req,res)=>{ 
    res.send("secret succesfull");
});


1.app.use(session({ secret: "mysupersecretkey" }))

This enables sessions in your Express app using the express-session middleware.

The secret is a string used to sign the session ID cookie.

It ensures the session ID can’t be tampered with on the client side.

Think of it like a "digital signature key" for your cookie.

After this line, every request coming to your server will pass through session middleware, which:

Checks if the client already has a session cookie.

If yes → loads the session data.

If no → creates a new session and sends a cookie back.

2.app.get("/secret", (req,res)=>{ ... })

This creates a route at http://localhost:3000/secret (assuming port 3000).

When the client visits this URL, the server will send back "secret succesfull" as the response.

Note If we are using same wesite in the same browser the express sessions will be same for both but if we open in different browser the it will be different

app.get("/reqcount",(req,res)=>{
    if(req.session.count){
        req.session.count++;
    }else{
        req.session.count = 1;
    }
    res.send(`You sent the request ${req.session.count} times`)
})


app.get("/register",(req,res)=>{
    let { name = "default"} = req.query;
    req.session.name = name;
    console.log(req.session.name)
    res.send(name);
})

app.get("/hello",(req,res)=>{
    res.send(`hello ,${req.session.name}`)
})


5. 🔹 What is connect-flash?

connect-flash is a Node.js middleware that works with sessions to store temporary messages (usually success or error messages).

These messages are available for only one request — after they are displayed, they are removed.

Typical use: login/logout notifications, error messages, form validation messages.

🔹 Why Do We Need It?

HTTP is stateless, so after a redirect, messages would normally disappear.
With connect-flash:

You set a message before redirect.

On the next request, you retrieve and display it.

The message is then automatically cleared.

5. What is res.locals?

res.locals is an object provided by Express that lets you store data which will be available only for that specific request–response cycle.

Think of it as a temporary storage bucket tied to the response.

Anything you put in res.locals can be used later in middleware, route handlers, or templates (like EJS, Pug, Handlebars).

🔹 Default Behavior

If you don’t specify a cookie object in session() options, Express will still create a cookie named connect.sid automatically.

It will store the session ID (signed using your secret).

By default:

httpOnly = true (so JavaScript can’t read it).

path = "/" (cookie is valid for the whole site).

No maxAge or expires (cookie is a session cookie → deleted when you close the browser).

secure = false (works on HTTP, not HTTPS).

So even without cookie: {}, sessions still work fine.
